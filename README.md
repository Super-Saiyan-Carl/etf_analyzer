Challenge 7 for DU Fintech Workshop

Attached you will find screenshots of what each answer looks like on voila.  

Overall, I thought the SQL portion of the challenge was easy, it was just figuring out a few plotting functions that I ended up getting hung up on. Hope to do more with SQL going forward.

I ended up putting 'multiple' down for the y label a few times and when the x-axis appeared to show the number of days in increment of 200 (don't know why it did that) I ended up putting the x label down as 'Days Gone By' in those instances.

Submitted the assignment with an hour to spare until deadline but was already considered 'missing' before I submitted it so there might be a bug or miscommunication when exactly these assignments are due.  Regardless, my time should be more free going forward where I don't cut it close at the end.

Had a number of fumbles with this Challlenge.
  The first being outside factors I had to concentrate on the entire week leading up to deadline where I couldn't start on the assignment until the final day.
  During my troubles, I couldnt figure out how to lower the amount of x-axis ticks so I extended the width of the first chart to 30000.  Hopefully I can figure out a     quick function for that.
  Then, I accidentally deleted the tables from the pd file somehow and saved over it in jupyter labs before I realized what I had done.  I had to start over from scratch but luckily remembered the code for most of the questions I had already completed.
